This project explores the market values of real estate properties in Russia and their influencing factors. \n

The data is retrieved from a real estate agency, which is an archive of sale ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia and the neigboring areas collected over the past few years. This project is the foundation for an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activities.\n 

There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is a userâ€™s input. The second type is inputted automatically based upon the map data, for example, the distance from the city center, airport, the nearest park or body of water.
